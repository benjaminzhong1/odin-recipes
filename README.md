TheOdinProject-Recipes 
This project is the first official project/assignment that I have done on TheOdinProject. It will be/is my website full of recipes of dishes that I've eaten in my life. The project will get me to be even more familiar working with html and what I have learned so far. Html boiler plate,headings, paragraphs, title, links and images, git and github functions as well as command line functions.
